# File Name : callback mr_poppins.exe

### If there are any stack alignment problems , change the file name to vulnserver.exe

# Hint

### This is slight modification of CALLback challenge

### We need to bypass those 8 null bytes.

### Since we can't use \xeb byte , we need to find POP POP RET Sequence.

### Use JMP - CALL - POP Technique so that next address will be popped into register 

### Then decrement that register and jmp to it
